[ ] mcp.js: to buy dependent augs for the next most expensive augs
[ ] mcp.js: to ignore Neuroflux Governor
    - mostly important for buying first round augs
[ ] mcp.js: to calculate true cost of all augs and only buy when the cash is available
[ ] general: outline path to ascension
    [ ] figure out overlapping augs for mainline hack factions
    [ ] find all non-hack factions with hack or rep augs
    [ ] make a list of all faction:aug pairs in order of rep and decide how much rep is required for each outline
    [ ] write library that evaluates progress and can be queried to ask for next faction to join/work/contract
[ ] general: transtion codebase to vscode-template
    - dependent on if work PC can run node.js ts compiler
    - https://github.com/bitburner-official/vscode-template
[ ] sleeve.js: add mode to work for faction/job, prioritized by needed augs
    - depends on library that figures out ascension goals and progress
    [ ] basic/brute implementation can be to work joined factions in order of totalRep if they have outstanding
        augs and have not hit the donation limit
[ ] NEW: write script to track work and quit and move on to next milestone when any of the following
    - working and hit faction join limit
    - contracting and hit donation limit
    - contracting and hit price of target aug (might not be most expensive aug if another faction sells duplicates)
    - next milestone functionality depends on library that figures out ascension goals and progress
    [ ] basic/brute implementation can be to quit on basic limits (max aug/domation limit/faction join limit) and
        move on to the faction with the next highest rep that has not hit the limits
[ ] NEW: write orchestrator to distribute and execute share.js script
